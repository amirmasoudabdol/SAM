## List of Strategies

SAM can execute complicated set of hacking stratgies on a given `Experiment`. A list of hacking strategies will be applied one-by-one and in the given order. `Researcher` can observe their influences on all outcome variables and decides when to stop, and what to report, see [here](Components.md#hacking-strategy) and [here](ExecutionFlow.md#perform-research).

The code below shows how you can define a chain of hacking strategies. The `--p-hacking-methods` is a *list of list of JSON objects*, [ðŸ¤¯](ConfigurationFileSpecfications.md#crash-course-on-json). You can define several groups of hacking strategies,  each listing different hacking strategies with different order and parameters.  Since JSON arrays' are ordered objects, this setup is suitable for controlling the order in which each group, and method in each group is going to apply on the `Experiment`. The example below defines 3 groups of hacking strategies with different number of methods in each.


```json
{
  "--is-hacker": true,
  "--p-hacking-methods": [
    [ // Group 1
      // {H1}
      ,
      // {H2}
    ],
    [ // Group 2
      // {H2}
    ],
    [
      // {H3}
      ,
      // {H4}
      ,
      // {H1}
    ]
  ]
}

```

A JSON object defines the specifications of each hacking strategy. The code below defines the *H1* hacking with three parameters. During the [initialization phase](ExecutionFlow.md#initialization), SAM reads the specification and prepare the hacking strategy accordingly. 

```json
{
  "type": "H1",
  "param-1": 1,
  "param-2": "yellow",
  "param-3": "at all cost"
}
```


The rest of this section lists all hacking strategies currently implemented in SAM. If you are interested to develop your own methods, go to [Extending SAM](extending-sam.md).

## Optional Stopping

Optional stopping is the practice of adding new observations to `Experiment`'s data after initial data collection. The incentive behind applying this method is often to achieve significant results. A researcher can perform this method in many different way, and here we have tried to provide a set of parameters that can collectively mimic as many different scenarios as possible. In order to add optional stopping to your list of hacking, you must replace one of the hacking methods, $h_i$ with the code block below. 

```json
{
  "type": "Optional Stopping",
  "mode": "Extreme",
  "num": n,
  "attempts": t,
  "max attempts": m,
  "level": "dv"
}
```

The optional stopping algorithm is implemented based on the fact that often a researcher perform multiple attempts to achieve significance. Here, `attempts` defines the number of attempts and `num` specifies the number of items â€” to be added â€” in each attempt. While you can implemented most scenarios of optional stopping by alternating these parameters, you can specify the `mode` parameters to override the parameters to some special cases. 

| **Parameters** | **Value** | **Description** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `num` | _n_, `int`  | Number of observations to be added on each attempt. |
| `attempts` | _t_, `int` | Number of attempts before stopping the process. |
| `max attempts` | m, `int`  | Maximum number of attempts |
| `level` | "item" | Adding new value to items in the underlying SEM. <br>**Note:** Only applicable in Latent Model. |
|  | "dvs" | Adding new values to dependent variables. |
| `mode` | "Extreme" | In each attempt, the algorithm adds ***n = 1*** observation to the dataset until it achieves significance. Both `attempts` and `num`  will be ignored in this mode. The process will stop after `max attempts` regardless of achieving significant.  |
| | "Recursive" (*Default*) | In *t* attempts, the algorithm adds *n* observations to the dataset until it achieves significance. |

## Outliers Removal

Removing outliers is another popular researcher's degrees of freedom. While use of outliers removal is not prohibited, most researcher are not aware of its consequences if applies poorly. 

Outliers removal method can be implemented in several different ways as well. In the simplest case, a researcher will decide to remove a datapoint from a dataset if the value is further than a distance from the sample mean. One common method is to compare the distance of a value to different multiplier of $\sigma$. This type of outlier removal can be deployed by defining the following parameters.

```json
{
  "type": "SD Outlier Removal",
  "mode": "Extreme",  
  "level": "dv",   
  "num": n,
  "n_attempts": t,
  "max_attempts": m,
  "multipliers": [...]
}
```

The main body of outliers removal algorithm is implemented similar to the optional stopping, where the researcher will add `num` items in `n_attempts` before stopping the process, or achieving significant results. Here though, you can also specify a list of `multipliers` to indicate the distance of an item to the $\sigma$. For examples, see [here](#examples.md).

Table below describes all the available parameters and their valid values.

| **Parameters** | **Value** | **Details** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `num` | *n*, `int` | Number of items to be removed at each attempt |
| `attempts` | _t_, `int` | Number of attempts to remove outliers for each multiplier |
| `multipliers` | `array` | A list of multipliers to be used. |
| `level` | "dv" | Removing outliers at dependent variable level.|
|  | "item" | Removing outliers at the item level, only applicable under Latent Model configuration. |
| `order` | max first, random |  |
| `mode` | "Extreme" | A researcher will remove **_n = 1_** outlier in each trial until he achieves significance. If more than one multiplier is provided, the process starts with the largest multiplier and continues recursively until there is no item can be removed from the dataset using the smallest multiplier. <br>**Note**: In this case, `num` will be ignored. |
| | "Recursive" | At each round, the researcher will remove _n_ outliers based on the given multipliers. He will advance toward smaller multipliers when no item can be removed using the larger values. In this case, `attempts` will be ignored. |
| | "Recursive Attempts" (*Default*) | The algorithm performs *t* attempts to remove *n* outliers from a dataset based on given multipliers. The algorithm will advance if there is no item left to be removed at *i < n* attempts, or after *n* attempts. |



## Group Pooling

Group pooling is the act of pooling data from two or more groups into one _new_ group and testing the significance of the data in the new group. Group pooling can be applied by adding the following JSON object to the list of hacking methods.

```json
{
  "type": "Group Pooling",
  "groups": [1, 2, ...]
}
```

| **Parameters** | **Value** | **Details** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `groups` | `array` | Indicates the number list of groups to be pooled together. |
| | "Recursive All" | In this case, all possible combinations of groups are being pooled together. |
