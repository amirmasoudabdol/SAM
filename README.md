> **SAM is under development and testing!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAM is a C++ program, and soon a library for simulating and studying the
effects of different p-hacking method, questionable research practices
or other researcher's degrees of freedom on the statistical inference
and meta-analysis metrics.

**Please visit the **[documentation](index.md)** page to learn more about
our design decisions and the available methods.**

If you like to install SAM before getting into more details, please
follow the instruction below.

# Dependencies {#readme-deps}

SAM uses a few well known C++ libraries to perform certain tasks.

-   [Boost](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.cpp), General purpose C++
    library
-   [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/), C++ library for linear
    algebra & scientific computing
-   [nlohmanh/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), JSON for Modern
    C++
-   [CMake](https://cmake.org), Automatic build system

On **macOS**, you can install all the dependencies using brew package
manager by running, `brew tap nlohmann/json` and then
`brew install boost docopt armadillo nlohmann_json cmake`.

On **Ubuntu**, you can use `apt` to install the listed packages by
running:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
    sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
    sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
    sudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev

For `nlohmann/json` and `docopt`, please check their documentation. You
probably must make and install them manually.

If you are using [conda](https://anaconda.org) package manager you can
install all packages via `conda` as follow

    conda install -c anaconda boost
    conda install -c conda-forge armadillo
    conda install -c conda-forge nlohmann_json

You will still need to manually install `docopt` since it's not included
in `conda-forge` repository.

# Build Process {#readme-build}

Once you have successfully installed all the dependencies, you can use
CMake to create SAM's executable using following commands:

    git clone https://amirmasoudabdol.github.com/SAMpp
    cd SAMpp
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

If everything goes right, you'll have a file named `SAMpp` in your build
directory which you'll be able to use to run your simulation with it.

## Testing (Optional) {#readme-test}

You can run SAM's unit test cases using `make test`. I design a few
tests to check the integrity of the code and API during the extension
process, e.g., implementing new hacking strategy. We will add more tests
as we improve our API.

# A Sample Run {#readme-sample-run}

After successfully building SAMpp, you'll be able to run your first
simulation. Executing `./SAMpp` in your build folder will start a
simulation based on the parameters in `SAMpp/input/sample-input.json`.

    $ ./SAMpp
    Initializing the simulation...

    Simulation output is saved in ../outputs/sample_simulation.csv
