<img src="docs/logo.png" width="200" align="right"/>

SAM is a **modular**, **flexible**, and **extensible** simulation framework for systematically studying researcher's questionable research practices as well as journal's questionable review practices. SAM is accompanied with [Frodo](https://sam.amirmasoudabdol.name/frodo/frodo.html). Frodo is a small project written in GNU Make and it is designed to facilitate the process of testing, and managing SAM projects.
